# Application Features

### Search Functionality
The application includes a search bar at the top of the homepage that allows users to search for countries by name. As users type in the search bar, the application automatically filters the results to show only the countries that match the search query.

### Filter by Region
The application also includes a filter by region functionality that allows users to filter the countries by region. To use this feature, users can click on the "Filter by Region" dropdown menu and select the region they want to filter by. The application will then display only the countries that belong to that region.

### Country Details
When users click on a specific country from the search results or the filtered list, the application will take them to a separate route page that displays more detailed information about the selected country. This includes the country's name, flag, population, languages, and currencies.
